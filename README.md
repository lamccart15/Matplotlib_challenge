Matplotlib Challenge: 

This challenge incorporated the use of pandas and matplotlib to analyze study data for an animal study conducted comparing treatment regimens for squamous cell carcinoma in mice. 

Included in the notebook are the following: 

- Cleaned data set to remove any mouse ID's with duplicate data
- Summary statistics table for the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard of error of the tumor volume per drug regimen
- A bar plot using both Panda's and Matplotlib demonstrating the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen 
- A pie plot using both Panda's and Matplotlib demonstrating distribution of male and female mice
- A calculation of the final tumor volume across the four most promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin)
- A calculation of the quartiles, IQR, and outliers for the most promising treatment regimens
- Box and whisker plots for the final tumor volume for the most promising treatment regimens
- A line plot demonstrating tumor volume versus timepoint for one mouse treated with Capomulin
- A scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for mice treated with Capomulin 
- A correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen
- General observations and insights drawn from the above analysis.
